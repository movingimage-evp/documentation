# Channel metadata

Channels can be assigned metadata, which includes standard and custom metadata.Â If your account is set up to provide metadata in multiple languages, you will see a drop-down menu in the top right corner for selecting a metadata localization set to edit. For more information about metadata localization sets, see theÂ Metadata LocalizationÂ chapter of the movingimage Administration Manual.

To edit the metadata for a channel, follow these steps:

1.  Click the â‹® symbol of the channel.
2.  Click the ðŸ–Š button.
3.  The channel edit area will open, pushing the video list to the right.
4.  Now you can update the channel's metadata using the fields provided. See the tables below for details.
5.  To close the edit area, click the ðŸ–Šbutton again or anywhere outside the edit area.

The Channel edit area shows both standard and custom channel metadata:

| Standard Metadata: ||
